# manhole-cover-classification

## About project
The aim of this project is to develop an image classification model, which should be able to classify different types of manhole covers . We don't have enough images to train the model. Sometimes we also have pictures of water pipe covers instead of manhole covers.
The available images are all unlabelled. Now we have to find a solution to ensure correct classification of manhole covers.
